# compression_coding
A collection of compression coding implementations

Just finished arithmetic coding, next up is probably dictionary methods (LZ78 or similar)
Only use the code found here for educational purposes, there are many security issues present

If you have ideas of what I should make next or improvements for current projects please send them through
